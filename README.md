# Project 1

## Details

I am building a Digimon http application w/PostgreSQL database usage

## User Stories

- "I want to see all the digimon in the digital universe"
- "I want to team up and tackle the digital world together"

## Changes

I have decided to move this project to Spring because I had multiple issues with Java/Tomcat/JDBC.
I had to digress on my prior issues to advance.
